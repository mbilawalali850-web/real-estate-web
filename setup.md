### 3. Create a new folder and go to the vs code and open the terminal, setup the virtual environment by following cmd:
```
python -m venv .venv
```
the last word venv is the name of the environment, so you can also change like python -m venv core

### 4. Activate your environment:
```
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
Note: venv is the name of your creating virtual environment, if you create virtual environment using another name like core so you have to run this cmd like 'core\Scripts\Activate.ps1
'
